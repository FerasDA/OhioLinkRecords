NOTE         "A prophet has appeared, coming with the Saracens": Muhammad's 
               leadership during the conquest of Palestine according to 
               seventh- and eighth-century sources -- The end of Muhammad's 
               life in early Islamic memory: the witness of the Sīra tradition
               -- The beginnings of Islam and the end of days: Muhammad as 
               eschatological prophet -- From believers to Muslims, from 
               Jerusalem to the Ḥijāz: confessional identity and sacred 
               geography in early Islam.
NOTE         The oldest Islamic biography of Muhammad, written in the mid-
               eighth century, relates that the prophet died at Medina in 632,
               while earlier and more numerous Jewish, Christian, Samaritan, 
               and even Islamic sources indicate that Muhammad survived to 
               lead the conquest of Palestine, beginning in 634-35. Although 
               this discrepancy has been known for several decades, Stephen J.
               Shoemaker here writes the first systematic study of the various
               traditions. Using methods and perspectives borrowed from 
               biblical studies, Shoemaker concludes that these reports of 
               Muhammad's leadership during the Palestinian invasion likely 
               preserve an early Islamic tradition that was later revised to 
               meet the needs of a changing Islamic self-identity. Muhammad 
               and his followers appear to have expected the world to end in 
               the immediate future, perhaps even in their own lifetimes, 
               Shoemaker contends. When the eschatological Hour failed to 
               arrive on schedule and continued to be deferred to an ever more
               distant point, the meaning of Muhammad's message and the faith 
               that he established needed to be fundamentally rethought by his
               early followers. The larger purpose of The Death of a Prophet 
               exceeds the mere possibility of adjusting the date of 
               Muhammad's death by a few years; far more important to 
               Shoemaker are questions about the manner in which Islamic 
               origins should be studied. The difference in the early sources 
               affords an important opening through which to explore the 
               nature of primitive Islam more broadly. Arguing for greater 
               methodological unity between the study of Christian and Islamic
               origins, Shoemaker emphasizes the potential value of non-
               Islamic sources for reconstructing the history of formative 
               Islam. -- Product Description.

NOTE         In The Warrior State, noted international relations and South 
               Asia scholar T.V. Paul untangles this fascinating riddle. Paul 
               argues that the "geostrategic curse"--akin to the "resource 
               curse" that plagues oil-rich autocracies--is at the root of 
               Pakistan's unique inability to progress. Since its founding in 
               1947, Pakistan has been at the center of major geopolitical 
               struggles: the US-Soviet rivalry, the conflict with India, and 
               most recently the post 9/11 wars. No matter how ineffective the
               regime is, massive foreign aid keeps pouring in from major 
               powers and their allies with a stake in the region. The 
               reliability of such aid defuses any pressure on political 
               elites to launch the far-reaching domestic reforms necessary to
               promote sustained growth, higher standards of living, and more 
               stable democratic institutions. Paul shows that excessive war-
               making efforts have drained Pakistan's limited economic 
               resources without making the country safer or more stable. 
               Indeed, despite the regime's emphasis on security, the country 
               continues to be beset by widespread violence and terrorism.

NOTE         "Praise for Adam Hanieh's Capitalism and Class in the Gulf Arab 
               States:"The first work to be published in English that gives a 
               full understanding of the formation and development of the Gulf
               capitalist class."-Counterfire In this illuminating and 
               original work, Adam Hanieh demonstrates that the Arab Spring 
               rebellions are about much more than democracy. Too often the 
               Arab uprisings have been reduced to a simple expression of mass
               protest against authoritarian regimes. In an accessible and 
               engaging style, Hanieh shows how an analysis of the specific 
               nature of capitalist development in the Middle East is key to 
               understanding these revolutions. Adam Hanieh teaches 
               development studies at the School of Oriental and African 
               Studies (SOAS). He is the author of Capitalism and Class in the
               Gulf Arab States. "-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         "Zoroastrianism is one of the world's great ancient religions. In
               present-day Iran significant communities of Zoroastrians (who 
               take their name from the founder of the faith, the remarkable 
               religious reformer Zoroaster, or--in the old Avestan language--
               Zarathustra) still practise the rituals and teach the moral 
               precepts that once undergirded the officially state-sanctioned 
               faith of the mighty Sasanian empire. Beyond Iran, the 
               Zoroastrian diaspora is significant especially in India, where 
               the Gujurati-speaking community of exiles from post-Sasanian 
               Iran call themselves 'Parsis'. But there are also significant 
               Zoroastrian communities to be found elsewhere, such as in the 
               USA, Britain and Canada, where western cultural contexts have 
               shaped the religion in intriguing ways and directions. This
               new, thorough and wide-ranging introduction will appeal to 
               anyone interested in discovering more about the faith that 
               bequeathed the contrasting words 'Mary' and 'magic', and whose 
               adherents still live according to the code of Good Thoughts, 
               Good Words, Good Deeds. The central Zoroastrian concept that 
               human beings are continually faced with a choice between the 
               path of 'good' and 'evil', represented by the contrasting 
               figures of Ahura Mazda and Ahriman, inspired thinkers as 
               diverse as Voltaire, Mozart and Nietzsche. Jenny Rose shows why
               Zoroastrianism remains one of the world's most inspiring and 
               perennially fascinating systems of ethics and belief"--

NOTE         "Not being of the West; being behind the West; not being modern 
               enough; not being developed or industrialized, secular, 
               civilized, Christian, transparent, or democratic - these 
               descriptions have all served to stigmatize certain states 
               through history. Drawing on constructivism as well as the 
               insights of social theorists and philosophers, After Defeat 
               demonstrates that stigmatization in international relations can
               lead to a sense of national shame, as well as auto-Orientalism 
               and inferior status. Ayşe Zarakol argues that stigmatized 
               states become extra-sensitive to concerns about status, and 
               shape their foreign policy accordingly. The theoretical 
               argument is supported by a detailed historical overview of 
               central examples of the established/outsider dichotomy 
               throughout the evolution of the modern states system, and in-
               depth studies of Turkey after the First World War, Japan after

NOTE         "With the help of British advisors, Sultan Qaboos overthrew his 
               father, the ruler of Oman, in 1970, yet few expected the new 
               leader to thrive. Sultan Qaboos was an unfamiliar figure to his
               own people, and Oman was a poor country wracked by multiple 
               civil wars. Nevertheless, Sultan Qaboos cemented his rule by 
               introducing a policy of national unification and assimilating 
               all of Oman into an oil rentier state framework. He also 
               promoted the idea that the figure of the sultan could embody 
               the state, which later led to a celebration of the sultan as an
               incarnation of Oman's "renaissance." Based on years of
               research, Marc Valeri treats the political career of Sultan 
               Qaboos as a case study revealing the social and political 
               mechanisms of authoritarianism in postcolonial states. Valeri 
               examines how Sultan Qaboos established and constantly renewed 
               his base in order to meet internal and external challenges to 
               his power. He also considers what happens when one part of this
               model, namely an oil-rent economy, falters, and the privileges 
               enjoyed by half the population are no longer tenable. In 
               particular, Valeri addresses the creation of a different model 
               and how this pursuit depends as much on the network of power 
               and privilege that has developed alongside polity as on the 
               interference of economic and technological forces. At the same 
               time, different and overlapping identities-ethnic, religious, 
               historical, or a combination thereof-persist and in some cases 
               reemerge, intertwining with challenges to wider state- and 
               nation-building exercises and to the regime's legitimizing 
               strategies. In conclusion, Valeri expands his focus beyond the 
               state of Oman, evaluating the practices of other Arab 
               monarchies in Morocco, Jordan, and the Persian Gulf" -- from

               self -- Beleaguering globalization and moral economy -- The 
               central domain of the moral.
NOTE         Wael B. Hallaq boldly argues that the "Islamic state," judged by 
               any standard definition of what the modern state represents, is
               both impossible and inherently self-contradictory. Comparing 
               the legal, political, moral, and constitutional histories of 
               premodern Islam and Euro-America, he finds the adoption and 
               practice of the modern state to be highly problematic for 
               modern Muslims. He also critiques more expansively modernity's 
               moral predicament, which renders impossible any project resting
               solely on ethical foundations. The modern state not only 
               suffers from serious legal, political, and constitutional 
               issues, Hallaq argues, but also, by its very nature, fashions a
               subject inconsistent with what it means to be, or to live as, a
               Muslim. By Islamic standards, the state's technologies of the 
               self are severely lacking in moral substance, and today's 
               Islamic state, as Hallaq shows, has done little to advance an 
               acceptable form of genuine Shari'a governance. The Islamists' 
               constitutional battles in Egypt and Pakistan, the Islamic legal
               and political failures of the Iranian Revolution, and similar 
               disappointments underscore this fact. Nevertheless, the state 
               remains the favored template of the Islamists and the ulama 
               (Muslim clergymen). Providing Muslims with a path toward 
               realizing the good life, Hallaq turns to the rich moral 
               resources of Islamic history. Along the way, he proves 
               political and other "crises of Islam" are not unique to the 
               Islamic world nor to the Muslim religion. These crises are 
               integral to the modern condition of both East and West, and by 
               acknowledging these parallels, Muslims can engage more 
               productively with their Western counterparts.

TITLE        Regionalism and rebellion in Yemen : a troubled national union / 
               Stephen W. Day.
IMPRINT      New York : Cambridge University Press, 2012.
DESCRIPT'N   xxx, 336 p. : ill., maps ; 24 cm.
SERIES       Cambridge Middle East studies ; 37.
NOTE         Includes bibliographical references and index.
NOTE         "Like other Arab revolutions in 2011, it is said that Yemen's 
               rebellion was modeled on street protests in Tunis and Cairo. As
               this erudite new study explains, however, what happened in 
               Yemen is far from being a mere echo of events elsewhere. In 
               fact, the popular uprisings which came as a surprise in Tunisia
               and Egypt, Libya and Syria, were already well underway in
               Yemen. As early as 2007, this country on the southern tip of 
               the Arabian Peninsula was embroiled in sit-ins, demonstrations,
               and open rebellion against the government. The author ably 
               demonstrates how Yemen's political upheaval is rooted in 
               divisions and conflicts of the past, especially the country's 
               troubled national unification in 1990. Based on years of in-
               depth field research, this book unravels the complexities of 
               the Yemeni state and its domestic politics with a particular 
               focus on the post-1990 years. The central thesis is that Yemen 
               continues to suffer from regional fragmentation which has 
               endured for centuries. En route the book discusses the rise of 
               President Salih, his tribal and family connections, Yemen's 
               civil war in 1994, the war's consequences later in the decade, 
               the spread of radical movements after the US military response 
               to 9/11, and finally developments leading to the historic 
               events of 2011. Politics in this strategically important 
               country is crucial for many reasons, not least on account of 
               its links to al-Qaeda terrorism. The United States and western 
               allies have good reason to regard Yemen as a security risk. 
               This book sets a new standard for scholarship on Yemeni 
               politics, and it is essential reading for anyone interested in 
               the modern Middle East, the 2011 Arab revolts, and 21st century
               Islamic politics"--Provided by publisher.

TITLE        Eurojihad : patterns of Islamist radicalization and terrorism in

NOTE         Includes bibliographical references (pages 197-216) and index.
NOTE         "Throughout history, factors of radicalization have involved 
               social and economic conditions and issues of identity. Patterns
               of Islamist radicalization in Europe reflect the historical 
               experience of European Muslim communities, particularly their 
               links to their home countries, the prevalence of militant 
               groups there, and the extent to which factors of radicalization
               in Muslim countries transfer to European Muslim diasporas. 
               Eurojihad examines the sources of radicalization in Muslim 
               communities in Europe and the responses of European governments
               and societies. In an effort to understand the scope and 
               dynamics of Islamist extremism and terrorism in Europe, this 
               book takes into account recent developments, in particular the 
               emergence of Syria as a major destination of European
               jihadists. Angel Rabasa and Cheryl Benard describe the history,
               methods, and evolution of jihadist networks in Europe with 
               particular nuance, providing a useful primer for the layperson 
               and a sophisticated analysis for the expert"-- Provided by

SERIES       Routledge handbooks.
NOTE         "The self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi in Tunisia in December 
               2010 heralded the arrival of the 'Arab Spring,' a startling, 
               yet not unprecedented, era of profound social and political 
               upheaval. The meme of the Arab Spring is characterised by 
               bottom-up change, or the lack thereof, and its effects are 
               still unfurling today. The Routledge Handbook of the Arab 
               Spring seeks to provide a departure point for ongoing 
               discussion of a fluid phenomenon on a plethora of topics, 
               including: - Contexts and contests of democratisation - The 
               sweep of the Arab Spring - Egypt - Women and the Arab Spring - 
               Agents of change and the technology of protest - Impact of the 
               Arab Spring in the wider Middle East and further afield 
               Collating a wide array of viewpoints, specialisms, biases, and 
               degrees of proximity and distance from events that shook the 
               Arab world to its core, the Handbook is written with the reader
               in mind, to provide students, practitioners, diplomats, policy-
               makers and lay readers with contextualization and knowledge, 
               and to set the stage for further discussion of the Arab
               Spring"-- Provided by publisher.
