NOTE         "A prophet has appeared, coming with the Saracens": Muhammad's 
               leadership during the conquest of Palestine according to 
               seventh- and eighth-century sources -- The end of Muhammad's 
               life in early Islamic memory: the witness of the Sīra tradition
               -- The beginnings of Islam and the end of days: Muhammad as 
               eschatological prophet -- From believers to Muslims, from 
               Jerusalem to the Ḥijāz: confessional identity and sacred 
               geography in early Islam.
NOTE         The oldest Islamic biography of Muhammad, written in the mid-
               eighth century, relates that the prophet died at Medina in 632,
               while earlier and more numerous Jewish, Christian, Samaritan, 
               and even Islamic sources indicate that Muhammad survived to 
               lead the conquest of Palestine, beginning in 634-35. Although 
               this discrepancy has been known for several decades, Stephen J.
               Shoemaker here writes the first systematic study of the various
               traditions. Using methods and perspectives borrowed from 
               biblical studies, Shoemaker concludes that these reports of 
               Muhammad's leadership during the Palestinian invasion likely 
               preserve an early Islamic tradition that was later revised to 
               meet the needs of a changing Islamic self-identity. Muhammad 
               and his followers appear to have expected the world to end in 
               the immediate future, perhaps even in their own lifetimes, 
               Shoemaker contends. When the eschatological Hour failed to 
               arrive on schedule and continued to be deferred to an ever more
               distant point, the meaning of Muhammad's message and the faith 
               that he established needed to be fundamentally rethought by his
               early followers. The larger purpose of The Death of a Prophet 
               exceeds the mere possibility of adjusting the date of 
               Muhammad's death by a few years; far more important to 
               Shoemaker are questions about the manner in which Islamic 
               origins should be studied. The difference in the early sources 
               affords an important opening through which to explore the 
               nature of primitive Islam more broadly. Arguing for greater 
               methodological unity between the study of Christian and Islamic
               origins, Shoemaker emphasizes the potential value of non-
               Islamic sources for reconstructing the history of formative 
               Islam. -- Product Description.

NOTE         In The Warrior State, noted international relations and South 
               Asia scholar T.V. Paul untangles this fascinating riddle. Paul 
               argues that the "geostrategic curse"--akin to the "resource 
               curse" that plagues oil-rich autocracies--is at the root of 
               Pakistan's unique inability to progress. Since its founding in 
               1947, Pakistan has been at the center of major geopolitical 
               struggles: the US-Soviet rivalry, the conflict with India, and 
               most recently the post 9/11 wars. No matter how ineffective the
               regime is, massive foreign aid keeps pouring in from major 
               powers and their allies with a stake in the region. The 
               reliability of such aid defuses any pressure on political 
               elites to launch the far-reaching domestic reforms necessary to
               promote sustained growth, higher standards of living, and more 
               stable democratic institutions. Paul shows that excessive war-
               making efforts have drained Pakistan's limited economic 
               resources without making the country safer or more stable. 
               Indeed, despite the regime's emphasis on security, the country 
               continues to be beset by widespread violence and terrorism.

NOTE         "Praise for Adam Hanieh's Capitalism and Class in the Gulf Arab 
               States:"The first work to be published in English that gives a 
               full understanding of the formation and development of the Gulf
               capitalist class."-Counterfire In this illuminating and 
               original work, Adam Hanieh demonstrates that the Arab Spring 
               rebellions are about much more than democracy. Too often the 
               Arab uprisings have been reduced to a simple expression of mass
               protest against authoritarian regimes. In an accessible and 
               engaging style, Hanieh shows how an analysis of the specific 
               nature of capitalist development in the Middle East is key to 
               understanding these revolutions. Adam Hanieh teaches 
               development studies at the School of Oriental and African 
               Studies (SOAS). He is the author of Capitalism and Class in the
               Gulf Arab States. "-- Provided by publisher.
