NOTE         Kofi Awoonor, one of Ghana's most accomplished poets, had for 
               almost half a century committed himself to teaching, political 
               engagement, and the literary arts. The one constant that guided
               and shaped his many occupations and roles in life was poetry. 
               The Promise of Hope is a beautifully edited collection of some 
               of AwoonorÆs most arresting work spanning almost fifty years. 
               Selected and edited by AwoonorÆs friend and colleague Kofi 
               Ahyidoho, himself a prominent poet and academic in Ghana, The 
               Promise of Hope contains much of AwoonorÆs most recent 
               unpublished poetry, along with many of his anthologized and 
               classic poems. This engaging volume serves as a fitting 
               contribution to the inaugural cohort of books in the African 
               Poetry Book Series. Book jacket.

NOTE         Includes bibliographical references and index.
NOTE         "Less than a decade after Washington endorsed a fraudulent case 
               for invading Iraq, similarly misinformed and politically 
               motivated claims are pushing America toward war with Iran. 
               Today the stakes are even higher: such a war could break the 
               back of America's strained superpower status. Challenging the 
               daily clamor of U.S. saber rattling, Flynt and Hillary Mann 
               Leverett argue that America should renounce thirty years of 
               failed strategy and engage with Iran--just as Nixon 
               revolutionized U.S. foreign policy by going to Beijing and 
               realigning relations with China. Former analysts in both the 
               Bush and Clinton administrations, the Leveretts offer a 
               uniquely informed account of Iran as it actually is today, not 
               as many have caricatured it or wished it to be. They show that 
               Iran's political order is not on the verge of collapse, that 
               most Iranians still support the Islamic Republic, and that
               Iran's regional influence makes it critical to progress in the 
               Middle East. Drawing on years of research and access to high-
               level officials, Going to Tehran explains how Iran sees the 
               world and why its approach to foreign policy is hardly the 
               irrational behavior of a rogue nation. A bold call for new 
               thinking, the Leveretts' indispensable work makes it clear that
               America must 'go to Tehran' if it is to avert strategic 
               catastrophe"-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         A small isthmus in the central Gulf, with barely 300,000 citizens
               and a total population of 1.7 million, Qatar has risen rapidly 
               from obscurity to become the world s wealthiest country per 
               capita. Matthew Gray traces this spectacular rise, exploring 
               the development of Qatar s economy, the patterns of its 
               politics, its role on the world stage, and its prospects for 
               the future.

NOTE         Overview: In this impressive synthesis, William Harris narrates 
               the history of the sectarian communities of Mount Lebanon and 
               its vicinity. He offers a fresh perspective on the antecedents 
               of modern multi-communal Lebanon, tracing the consolidation of 
               Lebanon's Christian, Muslim, and Islamic derived sects from 
               their origins between the sixth and eleventh centuries. The 
               identities of Maronite Christians, Twelver Shia Muslims, and 
               Druze, the mountain communities, developed alongside assertions
               of local chiefs under external powers from the Umayyads to the 
               Ottomans. The chiefs began interacting in a common arena when 
               Druze lord Fakhr al-Din Ma'n achieved domination of the 
               mountain within the Ottoman imperial framework in the early 
               seventeenth century. Harris knits together the subsequent 
               interplay of the elite under the Sunni Muslim Shihab relatives 
               of the Ma'ns after 1697 with demographic instability as 
               Maronites overtook Shia as the largest community and expanded 
               into Druze districts. By the 1840s many Maronites conceived the
               common arena as their patrimony. Maronite/Druze conflict
               ensued. Modern Lebanon arose out of European and Ottoman 
               intervention in the 1860s to secure sectarian peace in a 
               special province. In 1920, after the Ottoman collapse, France 
               and the Maronites enlarged the province into the modern
               country, with a pluralism of communal minorities headed by 
               Maronite Christians and Sunni Muslims. The book considers the 
               flowering of this pluralism in the mid-twentieth century, and 
               the strains of new demographic shifts and of social resentment 
               in an open economy. External intrusions after the 1967 Arab-
               Israeli war rendered Lebanon's contradictions unmanageable and 
               the country fell apart. Harris contends that Lebanon has not 
               found a new equilibrium and has not transcended its sects. In 
               the early twenty-first century there is an uneasy duality: Shia
               have largely recovered the weight they possessed in the 
               sixteenth century, but Christians, Sunnis, and Druze are two-
               thirds of the country. This book offers readers a clear 
               understanding of how modern Lebanon acquired its precarious 
               social intricacy and its singular political character.

               al-Maqdisi / Joas Wagemakers.

DESCRIPT'N   xxiii, 290 p. ; 23 cm.
NOTE         Includes bibliographical references (p. 251-276) and index.
NOTE         "Since 9/ll, the Jordanian Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi (b. West Bank,
               1959) has emerged as one of the most important radical Muslim 
               thinkers alive today. While al-Maqdisi may not be a household 
               name in the West, his influence amongst like-minded Muslims 
               stretches across the world from Jordan, where he lives today, 
               to Southeast Asia. His writings and teachings on Salafi Islam 
               have inspired terrorists from Europe to the Middle East, 
               including Abu Muṣʻab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of al-Qaida 
               in Iraq, and Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama Bin Laden's successor as 
               the head of al-Qaida Central. This groundbreaking book, which 
               is the first comprehensive assessment of al-Maqdisi, his life, 
               ideology, and influence, is based on his extensive writings and
               those of other jihadis, as well as on interviews that the 
               author conducted with former jihadis, including al-Maqdisi 
               himself. It is a serious and intense work of scholarship that 
               uses this considerable archive to explain and interpret al-
               Maqdisi's particular brand of Salafism. More broadly, the book 
               offers an alternative, insider perspective on the rise of 
               radical Islam, with a particular focus on Salafi opposition 
               movements in Saudi Arabia and Jordan"-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         One of the most important developments in the modern history of 
               the Middle East, the so-called Arab Spring began in Tunisia in 
               December 2010, bringing down dictators, sparking a civil war in
               Libya, and igniting a bloody uprising in Syria. Its long-term 
               repercussions in Egypt and elsewhere remain unclear. Now one of
               the world's leading Islamic thinkers examines and explains it, 
               in this searching, provocative, and necessary book. Time 
               Magazine named Tariq Ramadan one of the most important 
               innovators of the twenty-first century. He has won global 
               renown for his reflections on Islam and the contemporary 
               challenges in both the Muslim majority societies and the West. 
               In Islam and the Arab Awakening, he explores the uprisings, 
               offering rare insight into their origin, significance, and 
               possible futures.

NOTE         The key to understanding the Arab world today - and in the future
               - is unlocking its past. John McHugo takes the reader on a 
               journey through the political, social and intellectual history 
               of the Arabs from the Roman Empire right up to the present day.
               He covers the mission of the Prophet Muhammad, the expansion of
               Islam, medieval and modern conflicts, the interaction with 
               Western ideas, the struggle to escape foreign domination, the 
               rise of Islamism, and the end of the era of dictators. The 
               concise history reveals how the Arab world came to have its 
               present form, why change was inevitable and what choices lie 
               ahead following the Arab Spring.

NOTE         "Political Parties in Palestine is an up-to-date elucidation of 
               the Palestinian political landscape. The book offers vital 
               background information on movements such as Hamas and Fatah, as
               well as smaller political factions that have defined the 
               Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades but, due to lack of 
               available information, have not been subject to academic 
               scrutiny.The book provides a comprehensive discussion of the 
               ideological outlook, historical development, and political 
               objectives of all major political actors in the Palestinian 
               Legislative Council (PLC). A well-informed but accessible 
               overview, it combines analytical introductions with engaging 
               profiles of party founders, interviews with current party 
               leaders, organizational charts, and excerpts from party 
               programs previously unavailable in English"-- Provided by
